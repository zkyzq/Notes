1.线性组合: p=W[a:b],包括sum，weighted average
2.增加非线性激活函数（sigmoid ortanh），the nonlinearity al-lows to express a wider range of functions。
缺点：it is almost certainly too much to expect a single fixed matrix W to be able to capture the meaning combination effects 
of all natural language operators. Afterall, inside the functiong, we have the same lineartransformation for all possible 
pairs of word vectors.
